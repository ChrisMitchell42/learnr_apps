## Plotting a phylogeny with ggtree

We'll start by using ggtree to plot our tree. This is the base layer of the plot. Many additional arguments can be added to this command to customise the plot.

```{r tree-plot, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = TRUE}
ggtree(tree)
```
```{r tree-plot-solution}
ggtree(tree, colour = "blue")
```
